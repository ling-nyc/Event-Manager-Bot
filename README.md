Discord bot to simplify fundraising events. Large amount of this was mid-development, and I just stopped. Didn't even bother to clean up to do lists, it is what it is. Now open sourced.

## Everything is done pretty much. Theres some left though:

1. ~~Lock the $pay and $list to only people with `smuggler: "True"` in their jsons, along with server admins.~~ **DONE**
2. Add a command to allow the editing of user info
3. $listpaid command 
4. ~~Roll into production owo~~ **DONE**
5. (optional) add a field to $check where it displays past donations (not in the current event, Ex: They paid $15 during maid revolution, and $2 during santa, rn it will display Paid: $2 Total: $17)

## Commands list
si
	- /connect
	- /pay @user amount
	- /check @user
	- /stats (list serverwide total money raised)
	- /leaderboard
